# Traps of pandas

### Why we're here?
Be careful, playing with pandas can be tricky! You might find yourself tangled in loops, wrestling with data type issues, and in the end—whether you planned for it or not—everything ends up as a pd.Series. So, tell us: who's really getting the dummies out of whom?

### What to expect?
This repository contains only one Jupyter Notebook with a few examples of common pitfalls when working with pandas. The goal is to help you avoid these traps. I also provide data and code snippets to help you reproduce the examples.
